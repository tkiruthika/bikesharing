# bikesharing

## Overview
In this module, you'll work with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. First, you'll learn how to import, style, and portray data accurately. Then, you'll create worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.

## Results
### Delieverable 1

### Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

#### Deliverable Requirements:
Using Python and Pandas functions, you’ll convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After you convert the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, you’ll export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

### Delieverable 2

### Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis

#### Deliverable Requirements:

Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:
  - How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  - How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
  - A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
  
### Create the Checkout Times for Users Viz
In this visualization, you’ll graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

Your final results should look similar to the following image:

### Create the Checkout Times by Gender Viz
In this visualization, you’ll graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender.

Your final results should look similar to the following image:

### Create the Trips by Weekday for Each Hour Viz
In this visualization, you’ll graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap.

Your final results should look similar to the following image:

### Create the Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) Viz
In this visualization, you’ll graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap.

Your final results should look similar to the following image:

### Create the User Trips by Gender by Weekday Viz
In this visualization, you’ll graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap.

Your final results should look similar to the following image:

### Delieverable 3

For this part of the Challenge, you’ll create a story in Tableau and write a report that describes the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis you did in the module and in Deliverable 2.

## Summary
With all the Visualisations done above we can convince the investors that the bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.
Two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis
  - Checkout users by age.
  - Checkout by Start and End Stations.
